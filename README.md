need CAENVMElib
need ROOT (for TApplication, and probably data analysis/visualisation later)
need CAEN usb driver
maybe need CAENComm, but I'm not really sure

DigiDaq needs the date git repository for the header files. can probably just take the relevant headers out and avoid the recursive git repo in repo
